    "# A2 Text Adventure Game Development - The Hunger Games Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a game called \"Hunger Games\" which takes place in Panem. This game simulates a brief summary of the brutal competition in which two tributes from each district (part of the country) have to fight to the death. In this script, the player takes on the role of either the male or female tribute from District 12 and must train and fight to survive. The target of this is to prepare the player for the Hunger Games and close with the final decision of the movie. The game includes several functions, including a print out of the other tributes, three stages to win the game, and outputs of wins or loses. Additionally implemented, there is some basic error handling to ensure that input is valid and that the game does not get stuck in an infinite loop. Mostly all patterns of the course are integrated and there is no indication of bugs.\n",
